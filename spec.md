# Better Web Token Spec

## Summary

The Better Web Token (BWT) scheme specifies a web token format as well as the
corresponding generation and verification procedures.

The JOSE standards and its popular manifestation JWT are known to have numerous 
[design flaws](ðŸ”®) and [deployment pitfalls](ðŸ”®). BWT utilizes a fixed AEAD 
scheme, [XChaCha20-Poly1305](ðŸ”®), encapsulate all cryptographic operations, 
and the APIs for the token generation and verification procedures are lean and 
simple. By design, BWT aims to minimize the possibility of deployment 
vulnerabilities.

This document defines the BWT message format, as well as the token generation
and token verification procedures.

## Prior Art

Over the years a number of alternatives, [PASETO](ðŸ”®), [Branca](ðŸ”®), have been
developed. BWT is most similar to Branca which also uses
[XChaCha20-Poly1305](ðŸ”®). In contrast to Branca BWT utilizes key pairs instead
of symmetric keys. This reduces the risk of impersonation. Another notable
difference in comparison to Branca is the requirement that every BWT token
expires.

XChaCha20-Poly1305 is a well-analyzed, nonce-misuse-resistant, recently 
standardized, AEAD construction that requires a 192-bit nonce which due to that 
length can be generated with a CSPRNG. This approach is, given the PRNG is 
cryptographically secure, more robust than common counter-based generation 
techniques for shorter nonces.

## Design Goals

+ secure by default
+ simple to use
+ hard to misuse

## Token Format

Basically, a BWT token has the following textual shape `header.body.signature`.
All three token components are base64-encoded (URL-safe) and concatenated with 
a dot. The header basically encompasses the AEAD construct's additional 
authenticated data. The body part represents the actual ciphertext, whereas the 
signature is the corresponding Poly1305 MAC.
